SmartAccess

SmartAccess is a lightweight Android demo app built with Jetpack Compose + MVVM.
It demonstrates module access control, cooling period handling, and dynamic UI using a local JSON file.
A reusable AccessManager decides whether a module is allowed or blocked and shows proper banner/toast messages.
